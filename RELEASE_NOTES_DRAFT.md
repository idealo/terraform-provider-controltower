- **Provided recommended timeout values** for different use cases
- **Enhanced usage examples** with real-world scenarios
- **Added troubleshooting guidance** for timeout-related issues

## ‚ö° Improvements

### Better Error Handling
- **Clear timeout error messages** instead of generic failures
- **Context cancellation detection** with detailed error information
- **Improved debugging** for long-running operations

### Enhanced Account Deletion
- **Multi-phase timeout handling** for complex deletion operations
- **Separate timeouts** for Service Catalog termination and account cleanup
- **Reliable account closure** with proper async operation handling

## üîß Usage

### Basic Configuration
```terraform
resource "controltower_aws_account" "example" {
  name                = "Example Account"
  email               = "example@company.com"
  organizational_unit = "Sandbox"

  sso {
    first_name = "John"
    last_name  = "Doe"
    email      = "john.doe@company.com"
  }

  timeouts {
    read   = "45m"
    create = "45m"
    update = "45m"
    delete = "45m"
  }
}
```

### Recommended Production Settings
```terraform
resource "controltower_aws_account" "production" {
  # ... your configuration ...

  close_account_on_delete = true

  timeouts {
    create = "45m"  # Account creation can take 30-45 minutes
    update = "45m"  # SSO updates and OU changes need time
    delete = "60m"  # Account deletion and cleanup can be slow
    read   = "30m"  # Reading operations are typically faster
  }
}
```

## üìã Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

**No breaking changes** - existing configurations will continue to work with default 20-minute timeouts.

**Recommended updates**:
1. Add explicit `timeouts` blocks to your resources
2. Increase delete timeouts if you experience timeouts during account deletion
3. Configure `close_account_on_delete` based on your requirements

### Before (using defaults):
```terraform
resource "controltower_aws_account" "account" {
  name = "My Account"
  # ... configuration
  # Uses 20-minute defaults
}
```

### After (recommended):
```terraform
resource "controltower_aws_account" "account" {
  name = "My Account"
  # ... configuration
  
  timeouts {
    create = "45m"
    delete = "45m"
    update = "45m"
    read   = "30m"
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Upgrade Instructions

1. **Update the provider** to v2.1.0
2. **Add timeout configurations** to your Terraform files
3. **Test operations** in non-production environments first
4. **Apply changes** - no state migration required

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Account deletion operations** may now complete successfully where they previously timed out
- **Default timeouts remain 20 minutes** for backward compatibility
- **Configure longer timeouts** for production environments with complex setups
- **Account closure is asynchronous** - AWS may take additional time to fully process closures
